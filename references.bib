Based on typical design principles a motivating learning game is developed to train students in software design. We use Bloom's taxonomy to determine learning objectives. We keep the player engaged with direct feedback in a challenging level based game with increasing complexity. Players can evaluate their design actions with the help of the visualisation of control and data flows. The main learning objective: applying design principles, fits the game's main activity. This supports the learning by doing approach of lecturers. A user test indicates possible learning effects and a playable game.},

@inproceedings{Pedreira2015,
abstract = {Context: Gamification seeks for improvement of the user's engagement, motivation, and performance when carrying out a certain task, by means of incorporating game mechanics and elements, thus making that task more attractive. Much research work has studied the application of gamification in software engineering for increasing the engagement and results of developers. Objective: The objective of this paper is to carry out a systematic mapping of the field of gamification in software engineering in an attempt to characterize the state of the art of this field identifying gaps and opportunities for further research. Method: We carried out a systematic mapping with a view to finding the primary studies in the existing literature, which were later classified and analyzed according to four criteria: the software process area addressed, the gamification elements used, the type of research method followed, and the type of forum in which they were published. A subjective evaluation of the studies was also carried out to evaluate them in terms of methodology, empirical evidence, integration with the organization, and replicability. Results: As a result of the systematic mapping we found 29 primary studies, published between January 2011 and June 2014. Most of them focus on software development, and to a lesser extent, requirements, project management, and other support areas. In the main, they consider very simple gamification mechanics such as points and badges, and few provide empirical evidence of the impact of gamification. Conclusions: Existing research in the field is quite preliminary, and more research effort analyzing the impact of gamification in SE would be needed. Future research work should look at other game mechanics in addition to the basic ones and should tackle software process areas that have not been fully studied, such as requirements, project management, maintenance, or testing. Most studies share a lack of methodological support that would make their proposals replicable in other settings. The integration of gamification with an organization's existing tools is also an important challenge that needs to be taken up in this field.},

@article{Yohannis2014,
abstract = {In a state where games and their elements have been extensively used not only for pleasure but also for other purposes, gamification still has some pros and cons about its definition, which might influence people's decisions on their game-related strategies to improve their performance. This work tries to define gamification by using lexical meaning approach as the starting point and viewing it from a process viewpoint. Lexical meaning approach interprets gamification as a process or a product of the process. From this perspective, gamification can be viewed as a process that adds certain characteristics to an object that makes the object different from its previous condition and feasible to be formalized. Furthermore, the resulting definition is tested by comparing it to other existing gamification definitions and the understanding that constructs the definition is used as the foundation to explain the differences between gamification and serious games. This paper then defines gamification as a process that integrates game elements into gameless objects in order to have gameful characteristics. There will be a situation where gamification will produce a state of gameful reality: a situation in the real world where people can feel the significant presence of gamefulness in their daily life.},

@misc{Duval2006,
abstract = {cit{\'{e}} 813 fois, avril 2016. To understand the difficulties that many students have with comprehension of mathematics, we must determine the cognitive functioning underlying the diversity of mathematical processes. What are the cognitive systems that are required to give access to mathematical objects? Are these systems common to all processes of knowledge or, on the contrary, some of them are specific to mathematical activity? Starting from the paramount importance of semiotic representation for any mathematical activity, we put forward a classification of the various registers of semiotic representations that are mobilized in mathematical processes. Thus, we can reveal two types of transformation of semiotic representations: treatment and conversion. These two types correspond to quite different cognitive processes. They are two separate sources of incomprehension in the learning of mathematics. If treatment is the more important from a mathematical point of view, conversion is basically the deciding factor for learning. Supporting empirical data, at any level of curriculum and for any area of mathematics, can be widely and methodologically gathered: some empirical evidence is presented in this paper.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. Algorithms are commonly perceived as a difficult subject, which is quite an irony as they have a fundamental role in computer science. Failure to master this subject will inhibit students" capabilities as they advance to higher levels. Algorithm visualization, as an effort to overcome the problem, has been growing towards gameful visualization recently that is presumed to be able to engage learners longer and more intensely. However, integrating algorithm visualization, game elements, and instructional design is not a trivial task as it requires a careful design. Hence, a conceptual model of how algorithm learning instructions, algorithm visualization, and gamification improve learning outcomes was developed. While instructional design concerns with developing the best strategy for learning, algorithm visualization functions as a cognitive support provider and gamification works by delivering engagement. Both cognitive support and engagement moderate the learning instructions that concern with enhancing learning outcomes. Principles and elements originating from the three domains have to be taken into consideration during the designing process to produce an artifact that can deliver the essential functions of each domain. A working artifact was then constructed, as the instantiation of the model, to validate whether the idea of integrating algorithm visualization and gamification into algorithm learning instructions is capable enough to improve learning outcomes. Based on our respondents" learning outcomes, it was found the artifact can significantly improve the procedural knowledge of learners that are indicated by their increased capability in solving sorting algorithm problems.},

It has been identified as a promising technique to improve students' engagement which could have a positive impact on learning. This study evaluated the learning effectiveness and engagement appeal of a gamified learning activity targeted at the learning of C-programming language. Furthermore, the study inquired into which gamified learning activities were more appealing to students. The study was conducted using the mixed-method sequential explanatory protocol. The data collected and analysed included logs, questionnaires, and pre- and post-tests. The results of the evaluation show positive effects on the engagement of students toward the gamified learning activities and a moderate improvement in learning outcomes. Students reported different motivations for continuing and stopping activities once they completed the mandatory assignment. The preferences for different gamified activities were also conditioned by academic milestones.},
